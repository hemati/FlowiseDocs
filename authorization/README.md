# Authorization

Flowise has 2 authorization:

* App level
* Chatflow level

## App Level

App level authorization protects your Flowise instance by username and password. This protects your apps from being accessible by anyone when deployed online.

See how to set username & password [setting-username-and-password.md](setting-username-and-password.md "mention")

## Chatflow level

Imagine you have a chatflow constructed, and you only want certain people to be able to access and interact with it. You can achieve that by assigning an API key for that specific chatflow.

### API Key

In dashboard, navigate to API Keys section, and you should be able to see a DefaultKey created. You can also add or delete any keys.

### Chatflow

Navigate to the chatflow, and now you can select the API Key you want to use to protect the chatflow.

After assigning an API key, one can only access the chatflow API when the Authorization header is provided with the correct API key specified during a HTTP call.

```json
"Authorization": "Bearer <your-api-key>"
```
