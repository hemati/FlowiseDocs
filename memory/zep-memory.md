# Zep Memory

[Zep](https://github.com/getzep/zep) is long-term memory store for LLM applications. It stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches LLM app / chatbot histories, and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.

It is suitable when you are using LangChain.Space as API, and want the AI to remember conversations between different users. You can achieve that using **sessionId**.

## Deploy Zep

You can easily deploy Zep to cloud services like [Render](https://render.com/), [Flyio](https://fly.io/). If you prefer to test it locally, you can also spin up a docker container by following their [quick guide](https://github.com/getzep/zep#quick-start).

In this example, we are going to deploy to Render.

1. Head over to [Zep Repo](https://github.com/getzep/zep#quick-start) and click **Deploy to Render**
2. This will bring you to Render's Blueprint page and simply click **Create New Resources**

3. When the deployment is done, you should see 3 applications created on your dashboard

4. Simply click the first one called **zep** and copy the deployed URL

## Use in LangChain.Space UI

1. Back to LangChain.Space application, simply create a new canvas or use one of the template from marketplace. In this example, we are going to use **Simple Conversational Chain**

2. Replace **Buffer Memory** with **Zep Memory**. Then replace the **Base URL** with the Zep URL you have copied above

3. Save the chatflow and test it out to see if conversations are remembered.

4. Now try clearing the chat history, and see if it still remember the previous conversations

By default, the first chat message id will be used as **sessionId** for Zep Memory, allowing AI to remember the conversations.

When chat history is cleared, all chat messages will be deleted. When user ask a new question, a new chat message is being saved with a new id. The id of that first new chat message will then be used as the new **sessionId**. As you can see from picture above, it does not remember user's name after the chat history is cleared.

## Use in LangChain.Space API

To use as API, especially when multiple users are interacting with the flow, you can use **sessionId** to differentiate conversations between each user.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For instance, in your front-end application, you can dynamically generate a **sessionId** using a combination of **userid** and **timestamp**. When user clear the chats from your front-end application, you can generate a new **sessionId** with the same **userid** and <mark style="color:red;">**new**</mark> **timestamp**. This will begins a new chat session with no previous conversations memory.
