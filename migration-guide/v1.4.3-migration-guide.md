# v1.4.3 Migration Guide

In v1.4.3, we introduced a unified Vector Store node.

### Before

Previously, users would have to create 2 flows to perform upsert and query:

* Upsert:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Load Existing:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

With the current technique, there are 2 drawbacks:

* additional LLM call will need to be made in order for the upsert to happen
* any slight changes will caused the flow to be upserted again

### After

Now, user can just use one node to accomplish all:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Users now have the option to manually kickoff the upsert by clicking the **green** button at the top right:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It comes with the new API - `/api/v1/vector/upsert`:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In future, we will be rolling out feature for querying, deleting indexes. This is the first step towards a more flexible way of performing vector-related operations. We strongly recommend users to update to the new nodes.
