# Tools

Tools are functions that agents can use to interact with the world. These tools can be generic utilities (e.g. search), other chains, or even other agents.

Refer [here](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/tree/main/packages/components/nodes/tools) for a list of tools that are currently supported by Flowise.
