# Vector Stores

A vector store or vector database refers to a type of database system that specializes in storing and retrieving high-dimensional numerical vectors. Vector stores are designed to efficiently manage and index these vectors, allowing for fast similarity searches.

In LangChain.Space, there are several vector stores integrations that can be used. Each vector store has 2 elements:

* [Upsert Document](../use-cases/web-scrape-qna.md#upsert-flow)
* [Load Existing Index/Table](../use-cases/web-scrape-qna.md#load-existing-index-flow)
